This example demonstrates how to use Yggdrasil Decision Forests as a third party
library in Bazel. This directory contains a standalone Bazel workspace (notice
the WORKSPACE and .bazelrc files).

The code of the example (`beginner.cc`) is an exact copy of
`yggdrasil_decision_forests/examples/beginner.cc`.

Call `compile_and_run.sh` to run the example.
